## Description

***Backbone.js*** provides a structure for JavaScript-heavy applications by providing models key-value binding and custom events, collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, and views with declarative event handling, while connecting it all to your existing application over a RESTful JSON interface. This quick start tutorial demonstrates both a PHP and Node.js mobile web application structured using Backbone.js that pulls data from Salesforce using the REST API. In this quick start you will learn how to take this mobile web app and deploy it to Heroku.

The samples include a contact management app that provides basic CRUD access to the Contact standard object. Using this app, users can view, update, add and delete Contact records from any mobile device with a modern browser.
